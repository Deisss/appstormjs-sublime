# appstormjs-sublime
Welcome to the AppStorm.JS official [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) plugin.

The plugin helps with a bunch of snippets to facilitate AppStorm integration into Sublime Text.


## Installation
Use the usual Package Control:
```
Preferences -> Package Control -> Install Package -> AppStorm
```

Or shorter:
```
Ctrl+Maj+P -> Install Package -> AppStorm
```


Will do the job.


## Snippets
As AppStorm is a complex framework, the existing snippets are not complete: we provide important snippets only. But, you should have enough to slightly boost your productivity with ease!


## Contributions
We are looking forward in any help, it can be anything, from bug report and request to code, let yourself make a try!
